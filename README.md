# Software Development & Robotics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio—a curated collection of academic and personal projects that reflect my passion for robotics, software engineering, and system design. This repository showcases a range of work, from solo builds to collaborative efforts, spanning computer vision, embedded systems, and game development.

## Collaborative Projects

Some projects featured here were developed as part of a team. Below is a breakdown of my specific contributions:

- **CV Dead Trees**  
  Developed and integrated the DeepLab-based segmentation model. Other team members contributed alternative models and preprocessing pipelines.

- **Java Dungeon Game**  
  Co-developed core gameplay mechanics, UI logic and critically, object interaction and dynamics. Contributions are documented across my blog and my partner’s notes.

- **Presto Forum**  
  Participated in frontend design and features. Very basic and first frontend experience.

- **Micromouse**  
  Solely responsible for path planning algorithms and the OLED-based map visualization system. Some contribution to the mechanics and control systems.

## Solo Projects

Other projects are solely my work with some provided direction.

- **Cad Drawings**  
  Personal work, playing around with room and furniture design and challenging by drawing imitations.

- **C++ Exercises**  
  Recent student exercises exploring advanced C++ and STL usage for customised string_view and weighted_graph classes and tasks.

- **UR5e Whiteboard Writing**
  Program designed to control a UR5e robot to write simple string phrases and math equations.
